# Digital Gardening

Digital Gardens and their nature are way best explained by [this wonderful article](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). I just want to expand on that concept.

Digital gardens, or me, are a place to plant, nurture and sow ideas once they reached a sufficiently developed state. Digital gardens are a place to relax, unwind, and let ideas flow and merge together.

This is not a final product, not a blog post or not anything remotely usable out of the box for everyone. It's a space of raw experimentation and creativity.

If you want to take a peek at how my ideas are created and processed, this is a better way to get to know me other than a fully fledged, refined and processed blog post.
