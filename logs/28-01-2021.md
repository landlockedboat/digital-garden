## Life

These days, i've really been thinking about life, and about fear. Fear has been holding me back tremendously, not only by paralyzing me but also by making me feel my life was not worth living at all.

I don't really know how to put it into words, and it will not get easier as this log goes on, at least I don't think it will. But the thing is, my mind has been racing lately. Fear has been always a company of mine. And I am beginning to realise that a life in fear is not worth living. To embrace this fear and to accept that life is ultimately unfair and harsh it has really ben dawning on me that life and the universe are infinitely more beautiful that I initially thought possible.

Cynicism has always been a favorite of my mind to fall back on. Whenever I had any setback, cynicism was prone to take the wheel of my spiralling thoughts. It was like a wild ride that took me to the darkest places of my mind.

Lately I've been able to identify this downward spiral and change it.

I always thought that word was really unfair, from a nihilist perspective. That existence was suffering and that all this suffering was inherently meaningless.

But I have learned, looking at the most unfortunate people on earth, people born into poverty, in the global south, wherever injustice is more stringent and prevalent, that those people are full of drive and life. That they don't have the privilege of cynicism. They had no choice but to embrace the bluntness of life, to understand that they are ultimately responsible for their own life, because nobody else has lend a hand to them.

Listening to Dembow, and listening to all the people out there trying to improve their life, believing in God, believing in the beauty of life, the universe and believing in the good in other people, and fighting tooth and nail against any challenge that life throws at them, I understood that all has been connected from the beginning.

Trauma therapy, religion, motivational speeches, hype music, everything is saying the same to me now: love yourself. And don't lay there waiting for your life to improve. YOU NEED TO RESCUE YOURSELF. Letting go of childhood, acknowledging that it could have been better, turn the page and embrace your adultness. Embrace that you and only you are responsible to save yourself. And you are not responsible for saving anyone else.

Loving yourself is hard, but I also realized something pretty powerful lately.

## Why should I love myself

I should love myself because I was born with everything I love from other people. I was born with it and never lost it.

I am kind, I am smart, I am very strong, I am loving, I am creative, I am humble, I am helpful, I am disciplined, I am a hard worker, I am a good friend, I am a good partner, I am a good person, I have good taste, I love life, I am adventurous, I am curious, I am innocent, I am ingenuous and lots of other things that I know, deep down, that I am.

I was born perfect, as perfect as everyone else. We are all born perfect, as kids. It's life that puts us against the ropes and beats us up. Trauma, loss, addiction, all of this can dim the light we were all born with. But we need to realize that this light is always inside us, waiting for us to realize that it's still there.

## Fear

Fear should not make you freeze. Fear should make you fight. Fear of uncertainty, fear over losing your job, your future, your house. We are born with a torching light inside us. When we need this light, we squeeze our chest out. And it comes out. We are all bound by this light. All people, all animals, all life on earth is bound by this eternal, burning light that makes us move forward. We are born into a dangerous, cold, harsh world that puts us to the test. Each one of us shines its light outwards in a different way. But humans are the supreme expression of this light on earth. A light that is unyielding, determined, intelligent and oftentimes capable of unspeakable atrocities. This light has propelled us to where we are now. We are beginning to see our light reflected back on us. We are starting to understand ourselves and the world, and we are being more compassionate than ever. This light that emanates from all of us, fearless and real, is what is going to save us.

Fear is what we do when we dim our light. We dim our light when we are around people that are traumatized, when we are around people that needed to dim their light in order to survive. The harshest dictatorships and the biggest atrocities humanity committed were directed to dimming the collective light of the individuals. Fear is what keeps us looking down, cowering for the next blow. And that is okay. Sometimes fear is useful. But there are times where the fear in our head is bigger than whatever we fear the most.

We are born fearless, and we are taught fear. Fear is natural, but we don't know how to handle it.

We are animals of prey. We are not predators. We know fear because we've been preyed upon for centuries. We freeze. And we do the same when we sense the smallest hint of fear.

The biggest crusades the crooks of the world have embarked upon is the crusade against the light. There have been countless examples of people crushing the light of their people, but without light there is no progress.

Even the most gut-wrenchingly evil dictator needs the light of their people to move the nation forward. There is no other way around.

The light of the people is what makes or breaks a country. Spain is dimmed because many people have lost their light. We used to be the model for social justice, equality, poetry, science and progress all around the world.

Then the dictators came, and our light was dimmed. Did it work for them? Kind of. They did not want things to change, and things did not change. But they did change. Spain was not the same afterwards. We are a country of lightless people, the butt of every joke. We don't have the drive to fight no more.

But this is just a lie that we tell to ourselves. Because I do have the will to fight. And many other people have it too. We are an immensely powerful nation, an immensely bright human ecosystem that will see itself with all their light and glory sooner than later.
