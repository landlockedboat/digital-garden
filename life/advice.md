# Advice

When taking advice from someone, take a look at their lives, and their person in general. Do you life them? Do you like the life they're living?

If that person is a stranger on the Internet, you don't know their life and who are them as a person. Ask yourself: do I want to be that person who's giving me the advice to me?

One of the best answers to unsolicited, bad-faith advice might be to just state: "I don't want to be like you, thanks."
