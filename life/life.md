# Life

In [this twitter thread](https://twitter.com/vikepic/status/1317866242393460738) I think that I describe best what I think my purpose in life is about.

I want to be the person who I needed when I was a kid. I want to make a positive impact on someone elses childhood. The way I can relate more to it is by developing videogames.

## Notes

* I have yet to meet someone who's fought hard for living a better life and has not managed to do so. Every struggle has its reward. Or, at least, it's what's in your best interest to [believe in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LopI4YeC4I).
* Each day we accumulate more and more experience and knowledge. Also, we accumulate more fears, worries and trauma that might hinder our movement. To grow sustainably, one needs to focus on the knowledge obtained, and treat the trauma and worries that arise in the road.
