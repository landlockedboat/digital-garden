# Inspiration

## People that inspire me

* **[Jason Rohrer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Rohrer)** Computer programmer and artist. He aims to elevate video games to the category of art <sup>1</sup>, and to explore subjects and themes reserved for more consolidated forms of artistic expression, such as paint or poetry.
* **[Christer "McFunkypants" Kaitila](http://christerkaitila.com/)** Video game creator. I consider him to be kind of a "Bob Ross" of video games. I follow him on twitter, and his development of his latest game, a wildlife photography simulator, is so very pleasing to watch. He takes videogame development as an end itself.
* **[Bob Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Ross)** An ex drill sargent who ended up teaching painting over the PBS. He taught me about art, and about enjoying the process of creation.
* **[Fred Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Rogers)** A presbiterian minister who hosted a kid's show on PBS. He taught children that they are loved no matter what. I think it's a powerful message, and it helped me stay afloat on very hard times.
* **[Cristina Ortiz "La Veneno"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Veneno)** Spanish singer and trans rights activist. Born during the Franco dictatorship, rose to fame in 1996. Unapologetically trans and Andalusian, she taught an entire generation to be loud and proud about their identity, their values and their roots. She remains a key figure of the LGBTQ+ collective in Spain.
* **[José Monje Cruz "Camarón de la isla"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camar%C3%B3n_de_la_Isla)** Spanish cantaor<sup>2</sup> who helped popularize the _Flamenco Fusión_ genre. Working class and proud romani, was one of the main forces behind the consolidation of the contemporary Spanish roma identity and the civil rights movement of the 60's in Spain.
* **[Melchor Rodríguez García "El Ángel Rojo"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchor_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Garc%C3%ADa)** CNT militant, anarchist and political figure. During the Civil War, he protected several rebel prisoners from arbitrary executions. He was sentenced to death once the war was over, but thanks to thousands of signatures and letters from renowed people supportive of the regime, he was liberated from prison without charges. Catholic, falangist and anarchist people attended to his funeral, and honoring his figure, no violence ocurred. His motto was "One may die for his ideals, but never kill because of them", which I don't necessarily agree with. However, I do think that war crimes are never justified and that his labour was of immense bravery.
* **[Griffin, Travis, Justin and Clint McElroy](https://www.themcelroy.family/)** The McElroy family is just... so wholesome, and their masculinity and gender expression is something I really look up to. They are bright, hard working, and unapologetically geeky and soft and goofy. I shared so many laughs with them during their [podcasts](podcasts.md).

1. I consider the hierarchy on art and artistic expression to be problematic. [Here](art.md) I expand on why I think it is so.
2. The spanish term used to designate a Flamenco singer.
