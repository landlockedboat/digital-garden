# Cool command line programs i may forget about

* `lolcat`: like `cat` but with colors. 100% recommended
* `fortune`: random quotes on your terminal
* `cowsay`: pipe it with some text and a cow will say it: `echo "moo" | cowsay`
* `tldr`: like `man` but actually useful
* `cmatrix`: hacks
* `gitmoji`: a tool to use emojis responibly in your commits. I like it.
* `bashmarks`: bookmark a folder, then jump to it. Glorious.
* `whereis`: Dont know where some program is installed? Run `whereis program` and get a list of folders containing a reference (?Â¿) to the program. Very useful.
* `rtv`: Reddit Terminal Viewer! Very nice CLI for reddit.
* `doc2pdf`: Converts .doc, .docx, .ppt, .pptx, etc. to .pdf. Very convenient.
* `irssi`: IRC terminal client
* `pipes.sh`: Cool terminal screensaver.
