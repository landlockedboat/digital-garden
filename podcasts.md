# Podcasts

I like listening to podcasts, especially when doing mundane, repetitive work like cleaning stuff up. They fill the time, and provide interesting insights on niche themes I like.

## Podcasts I like

* **[A Life Well Wasted (2009)](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a-life-well-wasted/id303688916)** An internet radio show about video games and the people who love them. I love this podcast. [I tweeted about how it makes me feel](https://twitter.com/vikepic/status/1332070919720869898?s=20).
* **[The Adventure Zone](https://maximumfun.org/podcasts/adventure-zone/)** A tabletop game playing podcast featuring the Mc Elroy family as hosts. Fun and a lesson on TTRPG storytelling.
* **[Stop, Hack and Roll](https://stop-hack-and-roll-podcast.pinecast.co/)** A podcast about tabletop gaming and game design in general.
* ~~**[Cool Games Inc](https://www.stitcher.com/show/coolgames-inc)**~~ A game design podcast hosted by Griffin McElroy and Nick Robinson. Following [the controversy around Robinson](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/08/polygon-parts-ways-with-nick-robinson-following-twitter-claims/), the collaboration between Griffin and Nick ended, as well as with Polygon at large. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this podcast as of now, given the gravity of the accusations against him, but I enjoyed the time I invested on it.
