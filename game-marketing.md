## [You Suck at Showcasing Your Game - GDC (2017)](https://youtu.be/gB8CvsOjDvg)

Video about showcasing your game at game events. It lays out some tips, divided into "before", "during" and "after" the even has taken place. Very interesting and practical.

### Before the event

* Prints: Logos high up in the print
* Flyers: Don't do that
  * Instead: Business card-sized prints! (possible to be collectable, free stuff!)
* Set the game to convention mode
  * Shorter play sessions
  * Unlock everyting
  * Idle card
  * Fill empty seats with AI
  * Safe environment (dont let the player tweak options, streamlined experience)

### During the event

* Bring mints for your voice
* Avoid keyboards (simplify the game layout!!!)
  * Go wired if using game controllers (safety)
  * If mobile, get a big touchscreen or buy phone holders (again, safety)
* Height is super important. The higher you can get your prints, the better.
  * Two monitor setup, one for the players, one for the audience. Or just one big boy monitor high enough for the people in the back to see.
  * Get balloons
* Sound is very important, get a big boy speaker bro
  * NO HEADPHONES, you wanna speak with ur players
* LED lights!!!
* TV topper w/logo
* Buy food before the doors open
* Film stuff
  * Reaction cam (webcam recording the croud)
* Free stuff! Give free stuff to folks to attract people
* Tournamets get lots of eyes.
  * Free steam key to all spectators if hard challenge is won by a player.
* Give the spectators something to do!
  * Design a new character, get a reward!
* Elevator pitch: You'll repeat yourself a lot, THAT'S OKAY!
* Go out and meet people! TALK!

### After the event

* Edit your footage.
* Follow up with business cards, you may want to wait 3-4 days.
* Write a post mortem.
* Contest winners!
* You won't get a sales spike after the event. Probably helps with a sale after the event.
  * Builds an audience over time.
  * Events are for getting awesome relationships w/other industry people.
