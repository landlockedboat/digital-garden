# Self hosting

Self hosting is the practice of running popular online services locally. My reasons for doing this are mainly:

* Security: My setup is not accessible from the internet, it only lives on my private network. No man in the middle attacks or other nefarious stuff is prone to happen.
* Privacy: I own my own data. My information is not being stored in a server somewhere remote. It's in my own house, and only I can physically access it.
* Customization: I have the power to tweak at my heart's content everything I want. Since only I use the product, I can run it using the configuration that best suits me.
* Durability: I decide when to shut down a service. Tomorrow GitHub might be down and I might not be able to host any more repositories. With self hosting, the service ends when it's of no more use for me.

If you want to take a look at my current configuration, you can go over at my [Home Server](https://github.com/vikepic/home-server) repo, where I host all of what it takes to run my home server successfully.
